/**
 * *EmojiSet* package for working with emojis 😎👀✌️.
 *
 * Provides methods that can get all available emojis, get emojis by their groups
 * or get emojis by their keywords as well as searching by group or keyword.
 *
 * To get started, you can import the package using two methods:
 * ```js
 * // ES6 import
 * import EmojiSet from 'emoji-set'
 * // or CommonJS import
 * const EmojiSet = require('emoji-set')
 * ```
 *
 * All the methods are static, so they can all be called directly using the
 * `EmojiSet.` syntax.
 *
 * Enjoy! 🥳🎉
